It plays a vital role in computer networks, the internet, mobile communication, and digital systems.\n\nCharacteristics of Data Communication\n\nFor an effective data communication system, the following characteristics are essential:\n\n1. Delivery\n\nThe data must reach the correct destination device. If the message does not reach the intended receiver, communication is meaningless.\nExample: An email must reach the correct email address.\n\n2. Accuracy\n\nData should be delivered without errors. Any alteration during transmission can make the information useless.\nExample: A downloaded file should not be corrupted.\n\n3. Timeliness\n\nData must be delivered within an acceptable time frame, especially in real-time applications.\nExample: In video conferencing, delays can disturb communication.\n\n4.

Timeliness\n\nData must be delivered within an acceptable time frame, especially in real-time applications.\nExample: In video conferencing, delays can disturb communication.\n\n4. Jitter\n\nJitter refers to variation in the arrival time of packets. High jitter affects audio and video quality.\nExample: In online streaming, high jitter causes buffering and distortion.\n\nComponents of Data Communication System\n\nA data communication system consists of five main components:\n\n1. Sender (Source)\n\nThe device that sends the data.\nExample: Computer, smartphone, laptop.\n\n2. Message\n\nThe information being transmitted. It can be text, audio, video, images, or files.\n\n3. Transmission Medium\n\nThe physical path through which data travels.\nExample: Twisted pair cable, coaxial cable, fiber optic cable, radio waves (Wi-Fi).\n\n4. Receiver (Destination)\n\nThe device that receives the data.\nExample: Computer, mobile phone, server.\n\n5. Protocol\n\nA set of rules that governs data communication. It ensures proper formatting, transmission, and reception of data.\nExample: TCP/IP, HTTP, FTP.\n\nModes of Data Flow\n\nData flow defines the direction of communication between devices. There are three modes:\n\n1. Simplex Mode\n\nIn simplex mode, communication is one-way only. Data flows from sender to receiver, but not in reverse.\nExample: Keyboard to computer, television broadcasting.\n\n2. Half-Duplex Mode\n\nIn half-duplex mode, communication is two-way, but not simultaneous. Only one device can transmit at a time.\nExample: Walkie-talkie communication.\n\n3. Full-Duplex Mode\n\nIn full-duplex mode, communication is two-way and simultaneous. Both devices can send and receive data at the same time.\nExample: Telephone conversation, video calls.",
