      "text": "a) In Data Organization and retrieval applications, data structures plays an important role. 5 Define data structure and illustrate the classification of data structure with examples. b) Develop a program in java to read a sparse matrix of integer values in the 2D array format 10 and convert the sparse matrix to <row, column, value> format and search for an element specified by the user. Print the result of the search appropriately. c) Develop a program in java to multiply one matrix with another, and need to check first, if 10 the number of columns of the first matrix is equal to the number of rows of the second matrix. Now multiply each element of the column of the first matrix with each element of rows of the second matrix and add them all. OR",

Apply the sorting algorithm which works for application of playing cards and sort it. b) Define an array. Discuss the types of array. Give the syntax of One Dimensional Array 7 declaration and illustrate the creation of an array in java programming. c) Programmers might prefer to store the data in continuous memory locations in order to 10 improve the efficiency of program. Define and write the syntax and the instantiation of the data structure that can be used. Using the same, write a java program to find the second largest and second smallest element of ‘n’ integer elements. UNIT – II",

Develop a program to construct a singly linked list to enter records of different students in list, display the list and calculate the percentage of each student.

Also 5 write a java program that does the same. c) Evaluate the following postfix expressions using stack data structure. 10 i) 5 3 + 6 2 / * 3 5 * + ii) 7 6 2 + * 42 / - Also write a java program to implement the same. OR 6 a) Explain how the stack can be used to check whether a string is palindrome or not. Also 5 write a java program that does the same. b) Convert the following infix expressions into postfix form using stack. i) (a+b/c*(d+c)-f) ii) (a+b*c)/((d+e)*f)/g+h 10 Also write a java program to implement the same c) Write a java program to implement Stack data structure using singly linked list 10 UNIT-IV",
