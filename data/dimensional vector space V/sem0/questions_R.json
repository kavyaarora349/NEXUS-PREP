This opens the door for organizations to gain access to powerful infrastructure without having to purchase it themselves. • The most common economic way of investing in cloud-based IT resources is in the reduction or outright elimination of up-front IT investments (hardware & software purchases and ownership costs). – This is referred to as Reduced Investments. • A cloud’s Measured Usage characteristic represents a feature-set that allows measured operational expenditures (i.e., directly related to business performance) to replace anticipated capital expenditures. – This is referred to as Proportional Costs. • In its most basic form, opportunities to decrease costs are derived from the deployment and operation of large-scale data centers by major cloud providers. • Such data centers are commonly located in destinations where real estate, IT professionals, and network bandwidth can be obtained at lower costs, resulting in both capital and operational savings. • On-demand access to pay-as-you-go computing resources on a short-term basis (such as processors by the hour), and the ability to release these computing resources when they are no longer needed. • The perception of having unlimited computing resources that are available on demand, thereby reducing the need to prepare for provisioning. • The ability to add or remove IT resources at a fine-grained level, such as modifying available storage disk space by single gigabyte increments. • Abstraction of the infrastructure so applications are not locked into devices or locations and can be easily moved if needed. • Increased Availability and Reliability: • The availability and reliability of IT resources are directly associated with noticeable business benefits. Page | 1 • A hallmark of the typical cloud environment is its key ability to provide extensive support for: • increasing the availability of a cloud-based IT resource to minimize or even eliminate outages. • increasing its reliability so as to minimize the impact of runtime failure conditions. •  RAS: Reliability, Availability and Serviceability. •   – First used by IBM for their Mainframes (only to hardware). •",

Reduced Operational Governance Control: • Cloud consumers are usually allotted a level of governance control that is lower than that over on-premise IT resources. • This can introduce risks associated with how the cloud provider operates its cloud, as well as the external connections that are required for communication between the cloud and the cloud consumer. • Consider the following examples: ▪ An unreliable cloud provider may not maintain the guarantees it makes in the SLAs that were published for its cloud services. This can risk the quality of the cloud consumer solutions that rely on these cloud services. ▪ Longer geographic distances between the cloud consumer and cloud provider can require additional network hops that introduce fluctuating latency and potential bandwidth constraints. Limited Portability Between Cloud Providers: ▪ Due to a lack of established industry standards within the cloud computing industry, public clouds are commonly exclusive to various extents. ▪ For cloud consumers that have custom-built solutions with dependencies on these exclusive environments, it can be challenging to move from one cloud provider to another. ▪ Portability is a measure used to determine the impact of moving cloud consumer IT resources and data between clouds. Page | 2 Multi-Regional Compliance and Legal Issues: • Third-party cloud providers will frequently establish data centers in affordable or convenient geographical locations. • Cloud consumers will often not be aware of the physical location of their IT resources and data when hosted by public clouds. • For some organizations, this can pose serious legal concerns pertaining to industry or government regulations that specify data privacy and storage policies. • For example, some UK laws require personal data belonging to UK citizens to be kept within the United Kingdom.",

Page | 4 • Original files are often replaced by the new files that are created when data has been modified. • Storage processing levels and thresholds for file allocation are usually determined by the file system itself. • Block storage requires data to be in a fixed format (known as a data block), which is the smallest unit that can be stored and accessed and the storage format closest to hardware. • Using either the Logical Unit Number (LUN) or virtual volume block-level storage will typically have better performance than file-level storage. Object Storage Interfaces: • Various types of data can be referenced and stored as Web resources. • This is referred to as object storage, which is based on technologies that can support a range of data and media types. • Cloud Storage Device mechanisms that implement this interface can typically be accessed via REST or Web service-based (SOAP) cloud services using HTTP as the prime protocol. • The Storage Networking Industry Association’s Cloud Data Management Interface (SNIA’s CDMI) supports the use of object storage interfaces. • Each of these data storage levels is commonly associated with a certain type of technical interface which corresponds to a particular type of cloud storage device and cloud storage service used to expose its API.

A concern with operating system-based virtualization is the processing overhead required to run the virtualization software and host operating systems Hardware-Based Virtualization: • Hardware-based virtualization represents the installation of virtualization software directly on the physical host hardware so as to bypass the host operating system. • Allowing the virtual servers to interact with hardware without requiring intermediary action from the host operating system generally makes hardware-based virtualization more efficient. • Virtualization software is typically referred to as a hypervisor for this type of processing. • A hypervisor has a simple user-interface that requires a negligible amount of storage space. • It exists as a thin layer of software that handles hardware management functions to establish a virtualization management layer. • One of the main issues of hardware-based virtualization concerns compatibility with hardware devices. Page | 9 • The virtualization layer is designed to communicate directly with the host hardware, meaning all of the associated device drivers and support software need to be compatible with the hypervisor. • Hardware device drivers may not be as available to hypervisor platforms as they are to operating systems. • Host management and administration features may further not include the range of advanced functions that are common to operating systems.",

Failover systems are commonly used for mission-critical programs and reusable services that can introduce a single point of failure for multiple applications. A failover system can span more than one geographical region so that each location hosts one or more redundant implementations of the same IT resource Active-Active: • In an active-active configuration, redundant implementations of the IT resource actively serve the workload synchronously. • Load balancing among active instances is required. • When a failure is detected, the failed instance is removed from the load balancing scheduler. • Whichever IT resource remains operational when a failure is detected takes over the processing. Page | 14 Active-Passive: • In an active-passive configuration, a standby or inactive implementation is activated to take over the processing from the IT resource that becomes unavailable, and the corresponding workload is redirected to the instance taking over the operation. • Some failover systems are designed to redirect workloads to active IT resources that rely on specialized load balancers that detect failure conditions and exclude failed IT resource instances from the workload distribution.
