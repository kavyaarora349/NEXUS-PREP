Marks: 100 Duration: 180 mins.
UNIT I
Answer 1 out of 2 questions.
1) Design a DFA to accept binary strings that are multiple of 3 when interpreted in (10)
decimal. Also illustrate the processing of the string "01111"
a)
b) Compute the Eclosure of each state of the following Є-NFA and also convert the (10)
same into an equivalent DFA
c) Differentiate between the Finite Automata DFA, NFA and Є-NFA (5)
2) Define DFA and design a DFA to accept strings of a's and b's that either begin or end (10)
or both with abb
a)
b) What are distinguishable and indistinguishable states? List the benefits of minimizing (10)
the states of the DFA and minimize the states of the following DFA:
c) Define with example Alphabet, String, Language, complement of a language and (5)
string concatenation.
UNIT II
Answer 1 out of 2 questions.
3) Define regular Expression. And give regular expressions for the following: (10)
a) Binary strings whose length is multiple of 3.
Strings of a's and b's that either begin or end or both with ab.
L = { anbm | n , m >=0 and n is even number and m is odd number. }
b) State and prove pumping lemma theorem for regular languages also prove that the (10)
language L = { an | n >= 0 and is a prime number} is not regular.
Prove that regular languages are closed under Union and Complement operations.
c) (5)
